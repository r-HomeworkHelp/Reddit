    # XP: Minimum Post Requirement - square/curly/round brackets

    ~title (includes, regex): ['((\[|\{)|^\().*(\]|}|\))']
    action: remove
    action_reason: no square brackets at prefix

        ### Hello **{{author}}**,

        Welcome to r/HomeworkHelp! It seems like you have not attempted to structure your post title to classify your question's level and discipline/topic enclosed with **square brackets** as a title prefix.

        **e.g.** **[AS Level Physics: Light]** {{title}}

        ###Positive Examples

        |Examples|**square brackets** is being used at prefix (must) + topic (optional) + clear question|
        |:-|:-|
        |includes syllabus|\**[GCE 'O' Level Calculus: Differentiation\]** How to differentiate e?|
        ||**\[AP English: Essay Writing\]** Should all adverts be factual?|
        |includes grade|**\[Grade 8 Algebra: Complete the square\]** How to factorise ax^(2)\+bx+c?|
        ||**\[University Chemistry: Titration\]** What is my qs?|

        ###Bad Examples

        |Examples|*It still works, but strongly discouraged*|
        |:-|:-|
        |Grade/level is not specific enough|**\[High School Math\]** What is my qs?|
        |What is your question?|\[Grade 8 Algebra\] **Helpppp!**|
        |Do not attempt to circumvent square brackets requirement. Classify your question with square brackets|**\[Q\]** What is my question?|

        **There is no fixed list of standardised grades, disciplines or topics.** As long as you have tried your best to structure your post title to keep things organised in the following format: ***[<Level/Syllabus>: <Discipline>and/or<Topic>] Question?***, you are safe!

        Please delete this post and I am excited to receive your question again with everything well formulated and in compliance with our subreddit rules, Reddit rules and its T&C.

        **Pro-tip:** _Attempt to edit this post to extract the description so you do not have to re-write everything all over again._

        Do read up our subreddit [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/about/rules) so you are cognizant of how things work here!

        Thank you for your understanding!

        Hi **u/{{author}}**!

        **Congratulations! Your question is successfully submitted to r/HomeworkHelp!** Typically, you will receive an answer within 24 hours unless it is not a very popular field. Once your question is deemed answered, please remember to re-flair this post as `✔ Answered` to save our volunteers' time from reading through an already helped question.

        **Pro-tips:**

        1. **Google** the topic and try to learn it before posting your homework question.

        2. **Flair** your question appropriately so that users equipped with the right expertise can better help you. That is the sole purpose of flair—for you to receive help quicker from users who can do your level of question. Otherwise, all questions are all jumbled together so a supposedly qualified student wouldn't have helped you and would've given up searching; there is very little educators here because educators instinctively don't come here.

        3. Even if this is a **non-text** submission, you still have to include all details in one way or another. **e.g.** as *comments*.

        **Warning:** This whole subreddit is free-for-all. No offers and solicitations of payment should exist here. All answers by default are to be 100% quality and original. If you receive any PMs for solicitation of payment like tutoring, please ignore and discard it (and block the sender). This text is written in response to users' feedback that they are targeted for PM spam after they have posted here. PMs is out of our jurisdiction, unfortunately.

        All the best!

        _To stop receiving this PM notification, select an r/HomeworkHelp [user flair](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/how-do-i-get-flair-textimage-next-my-username) for your profile._

        Hello {{author}},

        **It seems like this post is not flaired.** Please be informed that although *flairing* was written under ***pro-tip*** I sent you in PM, it is a convention in r/HomeworkHelp for all posts to be well-organised and we (readers) will purposefully boycott poorly/recklessly submitted posts even though this is a non-binding guideline.

        **PS:** Switch to [Reddit Redesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8ke2l3/how_do_i_get_redesigned/)! This subreddit is not optimised for old Reddit. :(

        Thanks!

        _This is a harmless notice. No action has taken or will be considered against posts that are not flaired._

        **This is a one-time message from r/{{subreddit}}. You do not have to take any actions.**

        It seems that you are new to our subreddit. This subreddit is quite new too, we was just an abandoned barren subreddit until the end of 2018. We have propped up this subreddit to make it beautiful and functional with systematic flairing.

        **All posts (questions) flaired to its subject are considered unanswered** until someone makes a top-level comment (answer), AutoModerator (me) will then automatically re-flairs the post with a suffix ***—Pending OP Reply***. When an OP makes a comment on his/her own post, the post will then restores its original flair automatically to be part of the queue again.

        Sounds cool? ***But……!*** We need your co-operation to make sure this system functions the way it is expected to be.

        1. **Please only make a top-level comment if you are answering the question.** Otherwise, make a reply to [HomeworkHelpBot's collapsed comment](https://preview.redd.it/5jawivvd0lx31.gif?format=mp4&s=89d3b206960be59d33071599b16410b75b27ab95) (and tag the OP) if you want to make a comment about the question.
        2. **Only answer the question if you are going to give your best effort to it.** Your recent comment was noted to be less than 67 characters (for perspective: length of non-GSM SMS). I cannot interpret the context of your comment, but please assume all posts on this subreddit are sincere and formal.
        3. **Do not mention about PM or moving the discussion to another platform.** We are protecting the OPs from scam or dangers.
        4. Please help to **report** content that violates r/{{subreddit}} [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/about/rules), Reddit rules and/or its T&C.

        ###What have we told the OP?

        **Please assume that the OPs have already made their best effort of attempting the question and sincerely help them** as we have already conveyed all OPs the following points:

        > 1. Google their question before posting
        > 2. Classify the question in post title
        > 3. Flair their question
        > 4. Even if it is a **non-text** submission, they'd to include all details of the question one way or another
        > 5. The requisite details: instructor prompt or workings of the failed attempt to the question.
        > 6. Avoid all PMs soliciting of payment. They are bad peeps. Good strangers provide free and quality answer to the post.

        Keep all exchanges friendly and cordial, don't be grandiose.

        ####Dear u/{{author}},

        **This is a one-time message from r/{{subreddit}}. You do not have to take any actions.**


        Thank you for participating in r/{{subreddit}}. We appreciate your presence here and we hope you enjoy browsing this subreddit.

        We are are that you have selected the ***Educator*** flair and we would like to convey you the following message:

        > You must be a registered/official teacher in a school/institution. As a teacher, you must be aware of the weight of every word you say. When offering help to students, please be mindful of the syllabus requirements. All communications have to be done here in this platform, and in a cordial manner. Do not mix your personal opinions/beliefs with the objectives.

        To customise your flair, **create a new post to r/{{subreddit}}** with the following title: `Flair: Educator`, and the body (capped at 55 charac) as the input of your flair.

        **e.g.**

        > **Title:** Flair: Educator
        >
        > **Body:** US Professor

        yields an Educator-coloured flair with the text "US Professor"

        **If you are just a tutor, please do not use this flair. There is a designated flair for tutors.**
